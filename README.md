# SegNet- tensorflow implementation
The implementation for SegNet and Bayesian SegNet is based on two papers listed below: 

http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02680
Alex Kendall, Vijay Badrinarayanan and Roberto Cipolla "Bayesian SegNet: Model Uncertainty in Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architectures for Scene Understanding." arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.02680, 2015.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561
Vijay Badrinarayanan, Alex Kendall and Roberto Cipolla "SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation." PAMI, 2017. 

It has been fruther modified from the original implementation to include train and test scripts.

# Training and Testing
Use the correct config file location in ```train_model.py``` and ```test_model.py```

# Requirements
Requirement: Tensorflow-GPU 1.8.0

python: 3.6.0
